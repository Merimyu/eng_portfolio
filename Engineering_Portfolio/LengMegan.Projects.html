			<p id="bodyp">Project Date: Completed 23, September 2015</p>
			<p id="bodyp">Course: CSE </p>
			<p id="bodyp">Partner(s): Joshua Price </p>
			<p id="bodyp">In this project, the objective was to create an interactive game using Scratch, an online drag-and-drop coding website. I worked with a partner (Joshua Price; senior) to build and design a game that required simple user-interaction to control a character
				(monkey). Through this project, I learned much more about coding logic and how to incorporate both design elements and music into a Scratch game to create an interactive and visually appealing product. Although we did come accross a few problems during
				the building, we were able to overcome these challenges and improve the game. One such challenge was the shooting mechanics- the projectiles that the play used to attack the enemies were able to pass through and kill multiple enemies, which made the
				game less challenging. To fix this, we changed a few of the blocks within the shooting procedure. This project depended upon teamwork between partners- cooperation and communication were key to the development of our scratch game.

			<p id="bodyp">Course: CSE </p>
			<p id="bodyp">Partner(s): Christy Koh </p>
			<p id="bodyp">The objective of this project was to improve a premade app on MIT App Inventor, a program similar to Scratch that also works with drag and drop blocks. I worked with my partner Christy Koh to modify the provided code to produce a working, personalized
				photobooth app. Completing this project allowed me better understand variable roles and applications. Although we did come accross a few problems during the building, we were able to overcome these challenges and improve our app. One such challenge
				was the orientation/stretching of images. When we first tested the given code, we discovered that the pictures came out rotated 90 degrees and stretched to fit the canvas. To fix this, we made the app a 'landscape app' (horizontal orientation) and
				changed the sizes of the canvases to match the sizes of the pictures. Another challenge we encountered was the camera on the Asus tablets. Originally, we had planned on using an Asus tablet to develop our photobooth app, but we soon found that the
				Asus tablets did not support the camera function. In order to remedy this, we chose to switch to my Samsung tablet. We were soon able to catch up despite having spent multiple days resolving the camera function issue. Teamwork and constructive criticism
				both played a very important role in this project; the teamwork and helpful comments were what ultimately enabled us to successfully complete the project.

			<p id="bodyp">Partner(s): Yashila Bordag </p>
			<p id="bodyp">The objective of this project was to use Python to create a working 'text' adventure (an interactive, user-decision controlled story). My partner and I split the project into three main parts- the coding, the project documentation, and the improving/brainstorming.
				My role was to complete most of the coding, while Yashila focused on the project documentation. There were a number of obstacles we had to overcome; the attack system was too complicated and bugged, and I was absent for 2 school days. We worked together
				to simplify and improve the battle code, and eventually resolved the problem by removing unnecessary variables and basing the attack on items only instead of items and luck. In this project, teamwork and communication was key. Because we were able
				to properly communicate and express our ideas, we were able to work together efficiently and complete our project despite the challenges we encountered.

			<p id="bodyp">Course: CSE </p>
			<p id="bodyp">Partner(s): Nuha Haque (prerequisite problems only)</p>
			<p id="bodyp">The objective of this project was to use Python Imaging Library (PIL) to create an image manipulation function that worked to alter any image a certain way. Originally, my partner and I split the easier questions and were planning to work together
				on the actual project, but because Nuha had multiple absences and did not show up for the online meetings, we ended up stopping the partnership. My role was to complete most of the coding, including the two customized changes in the manipulation function.
				There were only a few obstacles I had to overcome; besides partnership communication issues, I spent a lot of time trying to fix errors in my code from simple syntax/logic typos. In this project, effort and understanding was key. Because I was able
				to learn most of the PIL tools by myself after working a few hours past 1:00am, I managed to finish the image manipulation function to a state where it was able to split an image into 9ths and shuffle the pieces.</p>

			<p id="bodyp">The objective of this project was to use engineering skills to develop a creative solution to a valid problem that currently exists. To do this, I spent a few days brainstorming ideas and conducting research on previously existing 'solutions' to the
				problems I thought of. Because my project was an app, I learned a lot more about how to effectively use App Inventor to create apps. I did run into a couple hurdles, like for example getting the song recommendations to actually provide a recommendation
				for the type/mood combo "vocaloid/happy", but I managed to make it work after changing some of the tinyDB tags. Although I didn't have a team or partner(s) to work with, I still spent some time collaborating with family to test out some of the functions
				in my Emotibot app by setting up an online form and discussing with each family member which features needed improvements or fixes.

			<p id="bodyp">Course: POE </p>
			<p id="bodyp">Partner(s): Sasha Padilla, Ethan DeGuzman, Isaiah Cruz</p>
			<p id="bodyp">The objective of this project was to apply knowledge about simple machines, circuits, and NetLogo to build a mechanical winch and a simulation of it on NetLogo. To do this, we first distributed the tasks with a Gantt Chart, then immediately began brainstorming
				designs for our winch. We decided to split responsibilities into NetLogo and the actual building. Our initial design was inefficient and did not always work because the chain kept slipping off of one of the gears due to a wobbly structure. We fixed
				this by attaching a string to stabilize that section of the winch, and also made some improvements to the winch drum in order to increase linear velocity. As I was part of the group responsible for the building of the actual winch, I was able to learn
				a lot about the effects of different gear configurations on the efficiency of our machine. This project emphasized good communication because in order to ensure that every team member understood how both the NetLogo and the mechanical winch worked,
				we had to spend time discussing the effects of each part of the simulation and the machine. Click

			<p id="bodyp">Course: POE </p>
			<p id="bodyp">Partner(s): Wesley Wong, Allen Nguyen, Mounica Padakandla</p>
			<p id="bodyp">The objective of this project was to use select one of a variety or provided problems and use VEX robotics and programming to develop a solution. To do this, our team first agreed upon a problem to solve, then each brainstormed until we came up with a design for a robot that would accomplish the task required. We then discussed as a team the pros and cons of each design, and used a decision matrix to select one design to build. Our robot was supposed to solve the problem of transporting parts from one location to another; it consisted of a cup-like structure with wheels that moved back and forth on a track. The "cup" used a single motor for power and utilized a potentiometer to change direction, as well as a number of bump switches and limit switches to start, emergency stop, and control the movement process. My main responsibilities in this project were using ROBOTC to program the machine and assisting with the building and documentation, so I was able to gain a significant amount of knowledge in using ROBOTC and how the programming actually affected the robot's actions. As a team, we had many obstacles to overcome, most notably the effectiveness of our transporting cup and the direction changing process. To make our cup better, we wrapped tracks around our initial single gear platform design to ensure that it could successfully hold objects, and to fix our direction changing problem, we attached 1/2 inch standoffs to the bottom of our cup to ensure that the bump switches on either end of the track would be able to register that the cup had reached the end. As this project emphasized teamwork and the division of group responsibilities for efficiency, I was able to demonstrate my communication skills and cooperation by explaining how the code I wrote worked to the rest of our team, and making sure everyone had a good understanding of all aspects of our project, including the parts they were not directly responsible for.

			<p class="titlep">Project Name: PCB Design</p>
			<p id="bodyp">Project Date: October 2018</p>
			<p id="bodyp">Course: DE </p>
			<p id="bodyp">Partner(s): None</p>
			<p id="bodyp">The objective of this project was to create a printed circuit board (PCB) from scratch, starting with the circuit design and finishing with a functional board. To do this, I began by designing my circuit in Multisim and tested it on a breadboard to ensure it worked. My circuit was supposed to make an LED "pulse" with a breathing effect; I'd taken inspiration from my Halloween costume and wished to design a light-up prop. The circuit consisted of two 555 timer sections, one to regulate the blinking and another to control the fade-out of the LED. Because this was an individual project, I was responsible for first designing and testing the circuit, using Fritzing to get the printed version, and masking/etching the design onto the board before finally drilling holes and soldering in the components. The masking and etching process proved particularly difficult, however, because my circuit (though I followed all instructions) refused to mask properly, and the copper traces would be missing/broken after the etching process despite the initial transfer going well. Another issue I encountered was the actual PCB not functioning. I tried making solder bridges and replacing components I suspected were faulty, but ultimately was unable to fix the board due to time restraints. Despite my final product not functioning as intended, I was still able to gain important experience with the actual PCB production process, as well as gain hands-on practice with soldering to enhance my skills.
