                      Thinker. Designer. Creator. I intend to become an electronic engineer who works with 
                      computers to design innovative new products. To achieve this goal, I aim to attend a college with 
                      a good engineering program. For example, colleges such as Berkeley, MIT, and Stanford all have reputable
                      Electronic Engineering programs. Since the day I first used a computer, I have been wanting to 
                      do more with them, to develop interesting solutions to the endless problem of boredom as well as 
                      create useful programs that improve our lives. I believe that by becoming an electronic engineer, 
                      I will be able to do this.

                      Hello, my name is Megan Leng. I am a senior at Dublin High School in Dublin, CA.
                      As I have developed a strong interest in computer science and programming, I am taking
                      courses for the engineering track at Dublin High. Currently, I am enrolled in DE, Digital Electronics,
                      in order to broaden my knowledge on the physical applications of engineering. 
                      I am fluent in HTML and Python, and I have worked on several programming projects, including but not
                      limited to an interactive Scratch game, a web crawler, and some web design activites. I have also
                      worked on a few engineering projects, such as building a mechanical winch and creating my own PCB.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      These last few years, as I continued to take courses pertaining to engineering and pursue 
                      extracurricular activities that might help me achieve my goals, I have come to better understand 
                      my own person. I am I often find myself spending hours upon hours to finally accomplish a difficult 
                      task, only to realize that I had been so passsionate about completing it that I had skipped a meal. In group 
                      projects, I tend to be the person who always runs a quality check on our completed product no matter how 
                      late at night it may be. I spend a majority of my free time designing cards, beading, and occasionally 
                      making ribbon flowers.
                    </p>
